       <b>Riot Games has taken on multiple genre giants with its new multiplayer FPS Valorant, a tactical shooter that blends the lethality of Counter-Strike with the character abilities of Overwatch.
       And like most every other shooter these days, that means having a roster of heroes and villains with backstories, drama, and reasons for shooting one another in the head.
       But everyone knows the why doesn't matter nearly as much as the how, so we created this handy overview of the ten Valorant characters and their abilities.
       Valorant's beta has already started, so take some time to get acquainted with the agents you'll be playing against or watching on streams.
       For a broader introduction to Riot's hardcore FPS, check out our extensive hands-on preview.</b>
     </p>
       <p class="lead card a"><strong>It's important to understand just how character abilities work in Valorant, since it's different from most other shooters.
       Instead of having access to several powerful abilities on short cooldowns, like in Overwatch, Valorant's character abilities are more varied, and most of them have to be bought, almost like frag grenades or flashbangs in CS:GO. Each character's "ultimate" even takes multiple rounds to recharge between uses.
       Your agent isn't stuck with a specialized weapon like in other character-based shooters.
       You spend money buying weapons (and armor and abilities) at the beginning of each roundâ€”exactly like Counter-Strike.
       Here's a quick rundown of each type of ability characters have:
       One ultimate ability - This powerful ability requires multiple charges to use that are earned from kills or completing objectives (like defusing the bomb).
       It might take three rounds or more before you have enough charges to use yours.
       One signature ability - This ability is automatically usable each round. How many times and how often you can use it varies between characters.
       Two purchasable abilities - Each character has two extra abilities that require charges bought from the store at the beginning of a round.
       Think of them like grenades in Counter-Strike, an optional item that gives you some extra utility in combat.</strong>

     <p class="card a">
       Strengths: Phoenix is an aggressive character who excels at rushing into combat and using his fire abilities to push other players around.
       Stepping into his own flames heals him, making his Blaze and Hot Hands abilities particularly useful.</p>

       <p class="card a text-center">
         Tips: Force enemies out of corners using Hot Hands, and be prepared to catch them as they try to escape.
         Learning how to curve your Blaze ability is essential for both offensive and defensive strategies.
         For instance, when entering a bombsite, curve the fiery wall to block your enemy's vision as your team pushes.
         When defending, put the brakes on enemy advances by placing the wall, topping up your health in the process.

        <b>Abilities</b>
        Blaze: Summon a wall of fire that blocks vision and hurts anyone passing through it. The wall can also be bent when casting.
        Curveball: Throw a flashbang that curves around corners.
        Hot Hands: Throws a fireball that covers a small area in flames after a short wait or when it hits the ground. These flames damage your enemies but heal you.
        <b>Ultimate</b>
        Run it back: Marks your current location and starts a short timer. When the timer expires, or if you die, you respawn at the marked location with full health.</p>
